# Snake Game with Voice Commands

This project is a classic Snake game with voice command inputs, built using C++, Raylib, and TorchScript. The game allows players to control the snake using simple voice commands. This project was submitted for a hackathon.

## Introduction

The Snake game is a well-known classic, where the player maneuvers a snake to eat food, growing in size with each piece of food eaten. This project adds a unique twist by integrating voice commands, allowing the player to control the snake using voice inputs like "up", "down", "left", and "right".

## Build
### Prerequisites

- **VisualStudio** with C++ workload installed
- **Python or Google Colab (Optional):** If you want to modify or retrain the Pytorch model.
- **Raylib:** Used for rendering the game.
- **Libtorch:** For loading and running the pre-trained model.

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-voice-game.git
    cd snake-voice-game
    ```
2. You can train the model from the given PytorchModel.ipynb
3. Download Libtorch from [Pytorch's Website.](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) Make sure to download Release Version.

4. Unzip libtorch and copy include and lib folder to RaylibTestGame folder where **RaylibTestGame.cpp** is present

5. You might need to copy all the .dll files to the folder where .exe is present.

6. Copy the model_scripted_cpu.pt file to the folder where .exe is present(if you retrain the model otherwise it should already be present).

7. Make sure you are Release Configuration in Visual Studio.

8. Run the Project

## Usage

- **Starting the Game:** Run the game executable.
- **Voice Commands:** Use your microphone to give voice commands:
  - "up" - Moves the snake up
  - "down" - Moves the snake down
  - "left" - Moves the snake left
  - "right" - Moves the snake right
- **Game Over:** If the snake collides with itself or the walls, the game will end.

## Dependencies

- **Raylib:** For game rendering.
- **TorchScript:** For running the pre-trained PyTorch model.
- **C++ Standard Library:** For basic functionality like threading, I/O, etc.
